#Init

class Dog:

    def __init__(self):
        #^^this is an init method, you always need to call it like this with the  2 underscores
        #a function inside a class like this, is called a method, theyre diff but thats the diff
        #this method will get called every time u create an instance of this class :
        print("inside __init__(self) hello, Laura !")
